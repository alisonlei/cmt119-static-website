            <h2 id="CT-skills">Discussion on CT skills in the Module</h2>
                <small>In this module, I have been introduced mainly to decomposition and abstraction.</small>
                   <h3 id="ct-in-module">CT skills</h3>
                       <p>The module has introduced decomposition through everyday examples such as cleaning a house. We naturally decompose the task into tasks or rooms, and this example shows that there can be different ways of decomposing. Applying the concept to programming, programming problems can be broken down into smaller cases and functions. For example, a Fibonacci function comprises two cases, a base case for the first and second terms and another case formed from the addition of previous two terms. Moreover, when we define a function, it is common to call other functions, and they can be seen as smaller parts of the complex function. Abstraction has been taught as an approach to studying computer science. When we are programming, we focus only on computer programs and ignore the architecture of computers, and their properties are simplified in the JS model. The necessary information to know in programming is using JavaScript to communicate with the processor, and data can be stored in memory cells. In addition, a program is viewed as an object that takes input, performs operations on it, and returns the output. Apart from simplifying details of software and hardware structure, we also apply the skill to disregard how a web browser, a JavaScript program, and an html file interact when experimenting JavaScript code so that we can place emphasis on forming an algorithm, a step-by-step solution. </p>
                   <h3 id="suggestions">My Suggestions about the Module</h3>
                       <p>I think abstraction can be addressed more in terms of how to adjust the level and categorize different knowledge at various levels. In abstraction, only a certain portion of information is selected so it can only explain a phenomenon under investigation. It is unclear how to determine where a piece of data should be located. As we research a problem, we encounter many ideas and spend time on learning them, but this does not guarantee answering our targeted questions. Moreover, I think the result of abstraction is similar to summarization because very often, it is only after we have gained an in-depth knowledge on a topic that we can explain the topic logically without too many details. Because filtering away details saves time when searching for irrelevant information and understanding it, abstraction is particularly useful when there is an urgent problem. In addition, problem formulation should be explained in the module. The process of solving simple problems is intuitive, even unconscious. However, the situation of ‘having no idea’ or ‘not knowing where to start’ can happen in more difficult problems. Learning how to research the problem is essential since it lays the foundation for abstraction and decomposition. If we have traveled before, we can book a holiday. If we know the definition of a Fibonacci sequence, we can disintegrate the Fibonacci problem into two cases. In these two examples, all necessary facts are explicitly given but we are not always aware of what is lacking when solving problems. Therefore, learning to identify the unknown crucial aspects and conduct corresponding research can help us solve new problems.</p>

            <h2 id="model">Opinions on the Proposed Model</h2>
                <p>I think parallelization, iteration, and automation should not be seen as CT skills since CT is a thought process, and these three terms often refer to how a program is executed. In addition, the meaning of data collection and analysis is vague to me. In the project example, putting devices from Arduino together was mentioned before creating an algorithm, so I interpreted it as implying gathering and collecting data. I could not see how the step is conducted in the example, and data collection also occurs when defining problems. Therefore, the model should pinpoint the difference in data between the two stages. The model unified the skills in previous papers. Some skills or terms were originally used as project assessment criteria, especially those in the second and third stages. I believe these criteria are more similar to external behaviors associated with CT rather than the underlying mental processes. In conclusion, the model can be improved by clearly defining key terms and examining the thought processes behind the procedures in programs and projects.</p>
