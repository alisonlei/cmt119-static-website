          <p>Hi, I am Alison Lei.I made this website when I was studying in the Cardiff University. It contains three reflective writings. That's why I put the image here. This was my first time to build a website so it was a little bit challenging for me, especially when searching for the CSS properties I wanted and understanding how the sizing and layout works practically. However, I think the overall experience is rewarding becuase I have developed researching skills in the process. </p>
