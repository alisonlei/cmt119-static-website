            <h2 id="web-fundamentals">Web Fundamentals</h2>
                <p>In web fundamentals, I have learnt HTML and CSS. Before the module, I thought building a website was mainly about decoration and would be uninteresting. However, developing websites also involves considering how to structure and present the content and make it responsive. Hence, I have spent much time on learning the two languages.  It was interesting to view the elements on the webpage as boxes, which can be arranged in different ways. I had never imagined text, photos, navigation bars, and other components could be rectangles. Since I am unaccustomed to this way of thinking, sometimes it is difficult for me to picture the webpage from the code. I will read more code to understand how various declarations combine to form the presentation so that I can be more fluent in transforming my image into code. For HTML, I have learnt what objects exist in a website, and there are semantic and non-semantic elements. At first, I could not differentiate between them since a tag’s name inherently refers to an object. As I delved into the differences, I recognized that I had overlooked the circumstance under which the word ‘semantics’ is used.  To illustrate, the name ‘division’ has an initial meaning of a part of something.  In the context of HTML which is a language for building websites, semantics refers to a webpage’s content. Distinguishing between content and containers also enables me to use appropriate tags to describe my webpage accurately.</p>

            <h2 id="computing-fundamentals">Computing Fundamentals</h2>
                <p>In computing fundamentals, I have learnt the basic components of procedural programming languages. The challenge of doing the exercises is translating human language into formal language. When I expressed a solution naturally, there were often ambiguous parts in the steps which resulted in unintended outputs. For example, when writing a function returning the minimum element of the array, the solution was framed as ‘go through the array, compare the elements, and return the smallest element’. My actual meaning was comparing the elements while traversing the array, as only two objects can be compared at the same time. Missing descriptions about time and numbers hindered me from making a correct sequence of instructions. I will need to be more precise in giving instructions. I have also learnt the different data types, memory storage and addressing, and encoding schemes. I think the lesson about encoding is interesting as it explains why a simple bit pattern can represent so many things". I want to learn more about the development of these creative concepts so that I can eventually devise my own solutions, either for entertainment or to solve real-world problems.</p>
                <br><p>In conclusion, I have learnt to use CSS, HTML, and procedural programming. All topics involve novel ideas which encourage me to pursue a career in software development. Additionally, they deepen my interest in language and logic, so I will dedicate more time to study them in  my free time.</p>
